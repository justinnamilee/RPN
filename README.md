# RPN
RPN Propagation Node

---

## What?
Just like it says, sort of.

## But really, what?
It's an RPN calculator with a virtual-CPU core you can program in binary.

## Goals?
I dunno, have fun, I guess.

## ... Goals?
1. Get a decent op-code table setup.
2. Build an assembler.
3. Get BASIC working.
4. ???
5. GCC?
6. GUI, maybe.
7. Build one with a RaspiZero.
